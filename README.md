# GP_MRAC_Code
Code for testing a Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) scheme to control the pitch of a plane under wing-rock dynamics, accounting for modeling errors by using Gaussian Process (GP) regression. Implementation based on [1].

## Disclaimer
This is an implementation of the method presented in [1] I presented for a Parameter Inference and State Estimation graduate class. I don't claim ownership over the methodology presented in [1].

In this case, the data in the training set will be discarded based on Kullbackâ€“Leibler (KL) divergence.

In this case, the oldest data point in the training set will be discarded.
